CONFOCAL REGISTRATION PROJECT
===============================

Gofigure2 Team,
Megason Lab

This project is aimed at automatically moving the confocal microscope while imaging.
It uses a registration process between timepoints to determine global displacement of the sample.

This is an experimental project :
for now: 
 * we use a translation transform in the registration process, which doesn't consider the shape modification of the sample.
 * we only register 2D images in a representative area of the sample.


in the future, we may:
 * use a non rigid transform and evaluate displacement in the border of the images.
 * modify the optimizer
 * modify the metric
 * take into account the 3rd dimension
 * use a Kalman filter to predict displacements
